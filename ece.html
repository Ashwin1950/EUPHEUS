 <h2> Why Electronics and Communications Engineering?</h2>
 <ul style="color: black;">
 <li><p>Electronics and Communication Engineering is one of the streams where you adapt practically pretty much all the concepts of science. </p></li>
 <li><p>It is among the few other streams that gives you this diverse yet paltry information on all the fields.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Creation of specialised networking systems and equipment called value added services. Call diversion, video conferencing to bind people all over the world.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Candidates expecting their shortcoming is in learning the programming dialects or lean toward a no coding stream, would by and large be taking this stream, not to overlook them, winding up in a product firm and turning into an engineer. </p>  
 <li><p>Also, people who aren't so secure with which field to seek after their profession would pick this, since they have a choice of picking either the product or the equipment side.</p> </li>
 <li><p>After graduation, an EC engineer is qualified to work in either core electronics job as well as a Contact Service Provider or Vendor Job. </p> </li>
</ul>
