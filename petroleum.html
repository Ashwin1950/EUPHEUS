 <p>  <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum Engineering is a 4-years engineering course that offers various specialization courses that deal with the production of hydrocarbons, which can either be natural gas or crude oil. The technical field of petroleum engineering requires having a detailed understanding of the physical properties of oil, gas, and water along with the process of oil exploration and processing of crude oils. </p></h3>
 <h3 style="color: brown;">It is a full-time, 4 years course.</h3>

 <h2> Why Petroleum Engineering?</h2>
 <ul style="color: black;">
 <li><p>The rapid increase in demand for oil all over the world and scarcity of the oil wells especially in developing countries has led to the surge pricing of oil. High oil prices mean an increase in exploration and production of oil, hence, a greater demand for experienced petroleum engineers.</p></li>
 <li><p>Travel: Travelling is one of the perks for the petroleum engineers, since they have to be on site or offshore for either drilling or mining process. They get to explore the remote locations in India and abroad.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Engaging Work: Even though petroleum engineers have a challenging job, the work involves high intellect and skills to pan out an ideal plan for the extraction process and dealing with numbers. One has to work in laboratories with advanced equipment most of the time to extract best results.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Excellent Pay: Petroleum engineers enjoy great benefits with excellent pay and an above average package than a basic engineer. Typically, the starting salary for a petroleum engineer lies within the range of INR 25,000 to INR 40,000 on a monthly basis. The package increases with years of experience and education. Along with that, they are rewarded with paid time off, numerous retirement plans, great health insurance packages since they work at mines and dangerous sites.</p> </li>
