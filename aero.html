 <h2> Why Aeronautical Engineering?</h2>
 <ul style="color: black;">
 <li><p>The industry has been growing rapidly since the 20th century. The industry is sure to grow more as more people travel through air. In developing countries like India the passenger traffic is increasing more than 15% every year.</p></li>
 <li><p>Aeronautical Engineering is a course with a specialisation and distinction, thus it cannot be done by people studying other streams. This makes the job of an Aeronautical Engineer very important. The world looks up to them.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Aeronautics and aerospace offer huge employment opportunities in research, design, and taking up jobs directly associated with the working and maintenance of aircraft. As a matter of fact, despite a large number of aeronautical job opportunities available, the country is currently facing a dearth of aeronautical engineers. So, choosing to pursue aeronautical engineering is contributing to the country’s growth in aeronautics and aerospace.</p> </li>
 <li><p>Since aerospace is a challenging and critical profession, demanding a high-level of commitment, hard work and dedication from the professional, the most reputed and the largest of organizations in the industry offer lucrative salary packages to aeronautical engineers. In India the salary begins with INR 500000 and with experience it rises to INR 10,00,000 - INR 12,00,000.</p> </li>
 <li><p>As an aeronautical engineer, you could have an opportunity to travel across the globe, and not having to pay for it, since your company will.</p> </li>
